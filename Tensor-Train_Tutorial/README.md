# Tensor Train Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to get a quick start into the [TT-Toolbox](https://github.com/oseledets/ttpy) for fast multilinear algebra computations. Here, we introduce the basic routines for multidimensional array operations in TT-format with examples, including a presentation based on the quick start document developed by Ivan Oseledets, Sergey Dolgov, Vladimir Kazeev, Olga Lebedeva, Thomas Mach, and developments at Yale by the Batista group.
